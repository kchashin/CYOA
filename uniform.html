You walk towards the uniforms and get the basic uniform since you have not yet been placed in a house. Everything you get has the Hogwarts insignia on it. As you tried on the clothes to be sure you get the right size an owl lands on your shoulder and hoots. You looked at it and tried to shoo it away to no avail. After a bit you realize that the owl is for sale seeing as it has a price tag on its leg. Your eyes widened and you decided to keep this owl. You would pay for it with everything else when you finished your shopping.
