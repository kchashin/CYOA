<p> My name is Katarina Chashin and I am 20. I am a Game Design Major and a Nerd. In my freetime I cosplay, but I have always dreamed of getting my Hogwarts letter. I have been into Harry Potter since I was 5 years old and always dreamed of a video game where I was the main character. I forgot about this dream and wish until I started my DIG 2500 class. So I decided as my CYOA I would make that dream a reality. One day though I will do more with this game and make it a sandbox game.  </p>
