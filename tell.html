<p> You sit back on the couch and wait for your parents to come home. You watch TV until they get home. When they get home you quickly tell them what happened today, and about the owl and letter. Your mom looks sad but she nods gently and tells you to go get packed, which you do quickly. Shortly after she takes you to the entrance and walks to it with you.</p>
<p id="situation"> Do you <a href="leave.html"> leave her behind</a>? <a href="bring.html"> bring her with</a>? or <a href="gohome.html"> change your mind and go home</a>? </p>
