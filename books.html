You go to get your books first and when you went to get the last book you needed, another person came over and grabbed the book as you reached for it, making you drop all your other books. He calls you a Mudblood and scoffs in your face. You hate people like this but you wanted to start off this new school and school year right. You try to ignore him and got up and picked up your books only to be shoved into a bookcase once you were fully standing, he laughs and walks off and you bite your lip trying hard not to cry.
