You go to get your quills and ink first. You find a quill that fits your hand perfectly. You get a couple containers of black ink since thatâ€™s what your supply list asked for. As you get your items you see someone who is about to drop all their stuff. You quickly put your items down and catch their falling items. You help them get everything sorted and you both begin to talk and quickly become friends. You both talk about your unexpected letters and promise to meet at the train station in a few days and sit together on the way to Hogwarts.
