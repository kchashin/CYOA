<p> You find Gringotts rather easily, seeing as it was the biggest place in this area. You go in and talk to one of the Goblins and give your name. They quickly took you to a vault. When you entered, your eyes widened at all the gold in the room. You see a note addressed to you. When you pick it up and read it, your eyes grew wide. Your parents are rather high up in the Wizarding politics and they knew they had to hide you, so they placed you for adoption in the muggle world. You find out that they are still alive. Inside the envelope was a address book with your families addresses, including where your birth parents live and work. You take some of the gold and stuffed your pockets so you can get your supplies once you realized this money was yours. The Goblins help you back to the outside and you walk around in shock. You look at two stores, Olivanders and a supply store, trying to figure out where to go first.</p>
