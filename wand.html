<p> You barely had time to step into Olivanders shop when suddenly you hear a voice. <q>I was wondering when you would come to this shop.</q> You froze and looked at the old man standing behind the counter, you open your mouth to question his words. He stops you and explains he knows both of your parents and was waiting for you to come and get your first wand as well. He helped you find your wand and finally, 6 wands later, one chose you and Olivander smiles explaining you will be just as powerful as your mother. You smile and go to pay him and he raised a hand to stop you, he tells you not to worry about paying, the wand was on the house, but he warns you to take care of the wand. You nod and leave. You smile at your wand and look across the way at the next store.</p>
