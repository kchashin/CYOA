<p> You are sitting in your living room on your couch, just relaxing and watching TV. It is a gorgeous Sunday and you are home alone. As you sit there watching a new episode of your favorite show, suddenly out of nowhere an owl flies through an open window and drops a letter in your lap before flying away. You were more shocked that the owl flew in the day time for a brief moment. When you looked down you saw a letter in your lap. You frown and decide to watch the episode until you got to a commercial. When a commercial came, you looked at the envelope and blinked. Looking at the envelope you see it says it is from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is addressed to you.</p>
