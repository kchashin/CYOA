<p> You decide to change your life around a bit and you open the envelope and read it. As you read through it you learned something. You are a wizard.  The more you read, the more it tells you, like where to go so you can get your school supplies, and to go to a place called Gringotts. You look at the time and realize your parents will be coming home soon.  In your head you briefly fight over whether or not you should run off and see what this all is on your own, or if you should wait until your parents get home and tell them about the  letter.</p>
